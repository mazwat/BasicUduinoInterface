# BasicUduinoInterface

### A unity project that demonstrates basic connection with Arduino using the Uduino plug-in

This interface shows how Unity UI components can be used to control an LED, a Servo, an LED dimmer and using a light sensor to adjust the colour of a unity object.
It demonstrates: Digital and Analogue inputs, Digital Pulse and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) serial communication.
